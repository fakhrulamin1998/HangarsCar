# HangarsCar
The study focuses on traffic sign recognition, a subset of the environmental  perception system's image recognition branch. Autonomous vehicles can  interpret and extract traffic signs from camera photos via ellipse detection.  LeNet uses a convolutional neural network to classify the extracted traffic  indicators in order to identify the next action mode for the car. To demonstrate  the algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to the Raspberry Pi and the L298N  DC Motor Driver Module. The car, which is operated by the test board, is used  to prototype a traffic signal recognition system and to mimic prospective  delivery robot application scenarios in the hangar.
